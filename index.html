								<div id="paragraph"><p>The improper disposal of needles is a problem in big cities and leads to the unsafe use of needles alongside the increase in injuries relating to improper disposal. Our solution is to provide used needle disposal bins in areas with the highest prevalence of needles in places they don't belong. People who use needles will drop them into the bin, and in exchange receive a clean needle to prevent them from accessing used needles.</p>
									<p>People who use needles will attend educational programming at local community centers to not only learn where the disposal bins are located but also how to use them and some more information on safely using needles. We will encourage people to go by using billboards and other kinds of ads to market our events. Some will appeal to pathos by presenting that if you are worried about your friends or family using unsafe needles, here is how you can help them do it in a safer way. The hope is this would be a call to action for them to step up and help the people they care about. Other signage will appeal to logos. We will put up statistics about the consequences of using needles in an unsafe manner and other scare tactics that push people to go to these events without other people pushing them to go. It will be similar to the scary lung pictures on cigarettes that may make a person think twice before smoking. </p>
									<p>We will get local community centers to participate by paying to rent out their space and using our own staff to carry out the events. If we need extra help, we will get high school and college students in the area to volunteer by incentivizing them with volunteer hours and internship opportunities that will help them stand out from their peers and make a real difference in the community. The waste bin technology will be similar to a coin machine and a vending machine. The needle will be dropped into a small slot (small enough that an entire hand cannot fit through) that will hit the bottom of the machine that has sensors on it to recognize that it is a needle. After it is recognized as a needle, the machine will take a clean needle in a separate compartment of the machine and drop it into a tray for the person to take.

								<p><div id="paragraph">We have been working as a nonprofit organization based in Maryland for the past few months. We have secured a few partners, but we still need to gain more credibility since we are so new. Our short-term goal for the first two years is to make a name for ourselves in the industry. We want to show that we are trustworthy and worth investing in. We need as much financial support as we can get because our company is not cheap and easy. It is a huge endeavor, and we need financial assistance to make a positive impact in Baltimore. We hope to get enough money after the first few years to add at least two needle waste disposal machines to the city. Our long-term goal is that within our first 10 years, we can decrease the amount of needles on the streets by 40%. </p></div>

								<p><div id="paragraph">The incentive for partners to work with us is by promising them a return on investment. We promised our investors 10% back within our first 10 years. After that, we will renegotiate the terms to keep the partnership financially worthwhile for them. Outside the money aspect, partners will want to work with us because it will be good publicility for them, and they can contribute to something meaningful that benefits the community. </p></div>
